## Project Overview

Adaha is an inclusive digital platform that empowers people with disabilities by connecting them to jobs and training based on their abilities — not their disabilities.
Built with an accessibility-first approach, it bridges the gap between talent and inclusive workplaces.

## Project Objectives
* Economic Empowerment: Providing real and sustainable job opportunities for people with disabilities.
* Social Integration: Building a bridge of trust between diversity-supporting companies and creative talents from people with disabilities.
* Changing Perception: Shifting the narrative from "need" to "achievement" through a dedicated success stories section.
* Implementing "Skills-First" Approach: Connecting users with job opportunities based on their actual abilities and what they can accomplish, rather than their disability type.
* Ensuring Global Accessibility: Developing a platform that adheres to international accessibility standards to ensure ease of use for everyone.
## Project Scope – Strategic & Impact Framework (Short Version)

## Project Plan
The project is executed through the following key phases to ensure a comprehensive and accessible solution:
## 1- User Research (Week 1)
* Conducted in-depth interviews and a broader survey with job seekers (including people with disabilities) to uncover job search behaviors, emotional states, major pain points, accessibility barriers, platform
frustrations, and key expectations.

## 2- Empathy & Personas (Week 2)
* Created Empathy Maps to capture what users think, feel, say, and do during job search; identified core needs/pains; and developed detailed personas representing diverse abilities, experience levels, motivations, goals, and obstacles.
## P3- Information Architecture & Validation (Week 3)
* Designed logical site structure and navigation optimized for accessibility ran card-sorting sessions with users refined hierarchy and labels based on results  documented final IA (pages, sections, features) as the foundation for design & development.
## 4- Content Strategy & User Flows (Week 4)
* Defined content requirements and essential information for each page/task mapped detailed, step-by-step user flows for core journeys (job search, profile creation, applications, training access) highlighted friction points and proposed improvements compiled comprehensive content + flow documentation.
## 5- Wireframes & Interactive Prototype (Week 5)
*Created low-fidelity mid-fidelity wireframes focusing on layout, hierarchy, and usability built clickable interactive prototype in Figma conducted early usability testing iterated on navigation, clarity, and task success based on feedback (visual design deferred to later stages).
