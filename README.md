## Project Overview

Adaha is an inclusive digital platform that empowers people with disabilities by connecting them to jobs and training based on their abilities — not their disabilities.
Built with an accessibility-first approach, it bridges the gap between talent and inclusive workplaces.

## Project Objectives
* Economic Empowerment: Providing real and sustainable job opportunities for people with disabilities.
* Social Integration: Building a bridge of trust between diversity-supporting companies and creative talents from people with disabilities.
* Changing Perception: Shifting the narrative from "need" to "achievement" through a dedicated success stories section.
* Implementing "Skills-First" Approach: Connecting users with job opportunities based on their actual abilities and what they can accomplish, rather than their disability type.
* Ensuring Global Accessibility: Developing a platform that adheres to international accessibility standards to ensure ease of use for everyone.
## Project Scope
* Digital Platform Development: Building a sophisticated digital platform to empower people with disabilities professionally and socially.
* Skills-First Matching System: Implementing a matching engine that connects users to jobs based on their actual abilities rather than medical classifications.
* Accessibility Integration: Designing a user experience (UX) that adheres to global accessibility standards, including screen reader support and high contrast.
* Employer-Candidate Bridge: Creating a functional interface for companies to find and recruit diverse talents.
